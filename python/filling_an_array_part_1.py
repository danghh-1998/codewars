"""
We want an array, but not just any old array, an array with contents!

Write a function that produces an array with the numbers 0 to N-1 in it.

For example, the following code will result in an array containing the numbers 0 to 4:

arr(5) // => [0,1,2,3,4]
"""


def arr(n=None):
    return list(range(n)) if n else []
